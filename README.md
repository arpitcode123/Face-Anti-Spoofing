This project focuses on countering face spoofing attacks on recognition systems through face anti-spoofing methods, with a specific emphasis on deep learning. The proposed "Attention based CNN Model with adaptive index spoofing loss for face anti-spoofing" is implemented and evaluated using HTER, enhanced by a custom loss function, SmoothHTERLoss. The approach involves incorporating attention through CBAM in the CNN network (NewModel). The comparison against pre-trained models (ResNet, VGG, Inception) on NUAA and LCC-FASD datasets demonstrates superior performance, yielding a lower HTER, showcasing the effectiveness of the devised model. The implementation was carried out using VS Code Python and Google Colab Pro.
